This is a copy of [mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib) on which I am planning (as soon as I find some time!) to store some of the code I wrote in LEAN this summer to prove the [Dedekind-Kummer theorem](https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/gradnumthy/dedekindf.pdf). 

Parts of what I wrote have already made its way into mathlib :
- [Results about sums of ideals in Dedekind domains](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9055), 
- [Results about quotients of polynomial rings](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9542),
- Results about successive quotients of rings : [here](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/8668) and [here](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9649),
- [Results about UFDs](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9108),
- Results about multisets : [here](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9038) and [here](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9038),
- Results about quotients of various structure : [here](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/8640) and [here](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/8617).

More of it is on its way :
- [Results about divisibility](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10941),
- [Results about UFDs](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9345),
- [Results about Dedekind domains](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9345).
